        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vast Superhuman Strength:</strong> Currently, Kratos possesses an immense and immeasurable level of superhuman strength, which seems to fluctuate depending on the situation at hand and sometimes on his rage and anger. Although he was originally defeated by Alrik at the beginning, later Kratos can easily subdue and rip apart many large and powerful beasts and creatures such as Undead Legionnaires, infected humans, monsters, and magical beings in half, using only his bare hands and could easily rip off Helios' head. He was capable of overpowering the Hydra, and preventing both Cronos and Atlas, the two strongest Titans, from crushing him with their fingers and even overpowered Kronos when he tried to crush him with two hands. In his battle against Hercules, who is considered to be unrivaled in terms of sheer strength, Kratos proved himself stronger, capable of stopping his charges and even forcing him backward and also able to break free from his bear hugs, throwing Hercules with great ease over a great distance, overpowering and pummel him to death despite his brother's invulnerability. He has always physically overpowered all other Greek Gods he fought in raw strength. His strength is unaffected by his age, as despite being now older in the Nordic Realm, Kratos' physical strength seemingly only increases over time, though the exact limit of his strength is unknown. He was able to easily snap the neck of a troll with his bare hands, lift, throw and even smash massive boulders with his fists, and overpower even among the strongest of the Norse Gods such as Baldur, one of the sons of Odin, and Magni, the strongest of the children of Thor which Kratos killed with ease. During his first encounter with Baldur in their fist match, Kratos (along with Baldur) was generating enough force to cause the ground beneath them to collapse like an earthquake, creating huge cracks in the ground. One of the greatest testaments of his strength in the Nordic Realm was when he pushed the World Bridge, a feat that JÃ¶rmungandr was able to accomplish and later lifts and flips Tyr's Temple only with little effort. Tyr's Temple contains the Bifrost, which is directlty connected with the World Tree, Yggdrasil, in which it's very existence supports the Norse World's creation altogether with all Nine Realms exist among its branches and its strains stretches into infinity transcending time and space. And another very impressive feat of strength is when Kratos was able to raise the Labyrinth from the bottom of Mount Olmypus up to the top, which was all done by him cranking a handle along a track in the floor. While this doesn't seem too hard, the Labyrinth probally weighed hundreds of thousands of pounds, and he also has to raise that all through an entire mountain's worth of solid stone, along with the weight of the giant metal chain that held it all together. Another increidble testament to his physical strength is being able was being able to hold his own in direct hand-to-hand combat with Zeus during their fight in Gaia's heart, when the two were pushing each other back and forth using the Blade of Olympus. Howerver, perhaps Kratos' greatest feat of raw physical strength, in Greece, is when he lifted up and threw the entire Colosuss of Rhodes across a massive harbour. Keep in mind, the Colosuss was easily over 300 feet tall and was comprised of metal and wood, which probally made it weigh over at least 200 tons. He was able to do this with minimal effort as well, which shows how strong Kratos is. Another incredible feat of raw strength is when he killed Zeus by beating him to death with his bare fists. Despite the fact Zeus had just been impaled through the stomach with the Blade of Olympus at full power, he was still the strongest god to ever exist in the Greek Realm, so he was still incredibly strong.</li>
            <li><strong>Superhuman Agility:</strong> Kratos has extraordinary agility, capable of easily jumping great heights and distance and landing without any problems, and swinging on ropes to cross long gaps. Kratos is also a very experienced climber, able to get quickly and safely over the mountains, buildings and etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Regenerative Healing Factor:</strong> Kratos is able to heal from injuries, even some mortal ones, at an abnormally fast pace. This does not guarantee an injury or any scar, as evidenced by his facial scar received as a child and abdomen scar as a result of being stabbed by the Blade of Olympus. In the Norse Realm, Kratos has also demonstrated the ability to near-instantaneously will his body to heal from wounds, although this takes quite an amount of effort and concentration on his part. Kratos can also constantly regenerate with the help of Ivaldi's armor and can use charms and talismans to regenerate.</li>
