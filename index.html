            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Born in Sparta, Kratos was a respected soldier and a Spartan General, up until he lost his wife and daughter when he killed them, 
        albeit by accident, under Ares' command, earning him the nickname of the <strong>"Ghost of Sparta"</strong>, 
        after which he renounced his service to the War God, eventually killing him and ascending to Godhood by becoming the new <strong>"God of War"</strong>,
         before exacting revenge against his father, the Olympians and the Titans who betrayed him.
